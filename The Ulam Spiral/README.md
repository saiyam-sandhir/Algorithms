# The Ulam Spiral: Visulaizing Prime Numbers

The Ulam Spiral is a fascinating visualization of prime numbers, named after mathematician Stanislaw Ulam. The spiral consists of a series of numbers arranged in a spiral pattern, with prime numbers highlighted in a contrasting color.

To create an Ulam Spiral, you start with the number 1 at the center of the spiral. You then spiral outwards, placing the numbers 2, 3, 4, 5, and so on in a clockwise or counter-clockwise direction around the center. As you place each number, you check whether it is a prime number. If it is, you highlight it in a different color than the non-prime numbers.

When you look at the resulting spiral, patterns begin to emerge. For example, you might notice diagonal lines of prime numbers, or clusters of primes that appear to be randomly scattered throughout the spiral.

The Ulam Spiral is not only a visually striking way to represent prime numbers, but it also provides a way to study their distribution and patterns. In fact, it has been used in mathematical research to help identify certain types of prime number distributions.

In this repository, you will find a script that generates an Ulam Spiral, allowing you to explore this fascinating mathematical concept on your own. Have fun exploring the patterns and structures that emerge as you visualize prime numbers in a whole new way.
